Playing with algorithms is not that easy, especially if you don't understand them fully. You might find that your algo is stuck in a valley, gets distracted completely or doesn't move at all. While trying to read [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.04747), I implemented the different algos mentioned in the paper, and found some interesting behaviours of these algorithms. In this post, I will show (not explain why!) you exactly that.
